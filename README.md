- As you can see, there's words written in kanji as far as possible in front of the nil line and the kana or Chinese meaning behind this line.

- If the meaning of a word is closer to what it appears, there will be no Chinese quoted in the rear.
- The number behind the world represent the quantities of meaning of each words. For example, `112` means there is three world in this line, each of which has 1, 1, 2 meanings to be remembered. If the number is like `001` or else something, the zero in the front will be abbreviated.
- The plus means `111...`. In another word, the words in this line each just have one meaning.
